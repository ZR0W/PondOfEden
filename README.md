sketch:
https://www.lwjgl.org/
maybe use this graphics lib?
CREATURE.java {
  behavior?
  position
  basic stats{health, hunger, etc}
}

RESOURCE.java

WORLD.JAVA

DISPLAY.java

assortative mating

self-percieved mate value


every creature starts with a self percieved value of itself. It goes out to find mates; if it is rejected by a mate of higer value, his self values decreases; if it is approached by a mate of lower value, his self value also decreases. 

perhaps start the self value of every creature at max? since only a decrease mechanic is introduced currently.
